You are welcome to use it for any purpose without paying me, but see

This version of Crypto++ has been compiled successfully with MSVC 6.0
and 7.0 on Windows XP, GCC 2.95.4 on FreeBSD 4.6, GCC 2.95.3 on
Linux 2.4 and SunOS 5.8, GCC 3.2 on Cygwin 1.3.12, and Metrowerks
CodeWarrior 8.2.

To compile Crypto++ with MSVC, open the "cryptest.dsw" workspace file
and build the "cryptest" project. This will compile Crypto++ as a static
library and also build the test driver. Run the test driver and make sure
the validation suite passes.  Then to use the library simply insert the
"cryptlib.dsp" project file into your own application workspace as a
dependent project. You should check the compiler options to make sure
that the library and your application are using the same C++ run-time
libraries and calling conventions.

A makefile is included for you to compile Crypto++ with GCC. Make sure
you are using GNU Make and GNU ld. The make process will produce two files,
libcryptopp.a and cryptest.exe. Run "cryptest.exe v" for the validation
suite.

Crypto++ is documented through inline comments in header files, which are
processed through Doxygen to produce an HTML reference manual. You can find
a link to the manual from http://www.cryptopp.com. Also at that site is
the Crypto++ FAQ, which you should browse through before attempting to 
use this library, because it will likely answer many of questions that
may come up.

If you run into any problems, please try the Crypto++ mailing list.
The subscription information and the list archive are available on
http://www.cryptopp.com. You can also email me directly at
cryptopp@weidai.com, but you will probably get a faster response through
the mailing list.

Finally, a couple of usage notes to keep in mind: 

1. If a constructor for A takes a pointer to an object B (except primitive
types such as int and char), then A owns B and will delete B at A's
destruction.  If a constructor for A takes a reference to an object B,
then the caller retains ownership of B and should not destroy it until
A no longer needs it. 

2. Crypto++ is thread safe at the class level. This means you can use
Crypto++ safely in a multithreaded application, but you must provide
synchronization when multiple threads access a common Crypto++ object.
